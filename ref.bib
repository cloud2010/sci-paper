	abstract = {Drugs can produce intended therapeutic effects to treat different diseases. However, they may also cause side effects at the same time. For an approved drug, it is best to detect all side effects it can produce. Otherwise, it may bring great risks for pharmaceuticals companies as well as be harmful to human body. It is urgent to design quick and reliable identification methods to detect the side effects for a given drug. In this study, a binary classification model was proposed to predict drug side effects. Different from most previous methods, our model termed the pair of drug and side effect as a sample and convert the original problem to a binary classification problem. Based on the similarity idea, each pair was represented by five features, each of which was derived from a type of drug property. The strong machine learning algorithm, random forest, was adopted as the prediction engine. The ten-fold cross-validation on five datasets with different negative samples indicated that the proposed model yielded a good performance of Matthews correlation coefficient around 0.550 and AUC around 0.8492. In addition, we also analyzed the contribution of each drug property for construction of the model. The results indicated that drug similarity in fingerprint was most related to the prediction of drug side effects and all drug properties gave less or more contributions.},

	abstract = {Tissue-specific gene expression has long been recognized as a crucial key for understanding tissue development and function. Efforts have been made in the past decade to identify tissue-specific expression profiles, such as the Human Proteome Atlas and FANTOM5. However, these studies mainly focused on "qualitatively tissue-specific expressed genes" which are highly enriched in one or a group of tissues but paid less attention to "quantitatively tissue-specific expressed genes", which are expressed in all or most tissues but with differential expression levels. In this study, we applied machine learning algorithms to build a computational method for identifying "quantitatively tissue-specific expressed genes" capable of distinguishing 25 human tissues from their expression patterns. Our results uncovered the expression of 432 genes as optimal features for tissue classification, which were obtained with a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of more than 0.99 yielded by a support vector machine (SVM). This constructed model was superior to the SVM model using tissue enriched genes and yielded MCC of 0.985 on an independent test dataset, indicating its good generalization ability. These 432 genes were proven to be widely expressed in multiple tissues and a literature review of the top 23 genes found that most of them support their discriminating powers. As a complement to previous studies, our discovery of these quantitatively tissue-specific genes provides insights into the detailed understanding of tissue development and function.},

	abstract = {Adult neural stem cells (NSCs) are a group of multi-potent, self-renewing progenitor cells that contribute to the generation of new neurons and oligodendrocytes. Three subtypes of NSCs can be isolated based on the stages of the NSC lineage, including quiescent neural stem cells (qNSCs), activated neural stem cells (aNSCs) and neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Although it is widely accepted that these three groups of NSCs play different roles in the development of the nervous system, their molecular signatures are poorly understood. In this study, we applied the Monte-Carlo Feature Selection (MCFS) method to identify the gene expression signatures, which can yield a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) value of 0.918 with a support vector machine evaluated by ten-fold cross-validation. In addition, some classification rules yielded by the MCFS program for distinguishing above three subtypes were reported. Our results not only demonstrate a high classification capacity and subtype-specific gene expression patterns but also quantitatively reflect the pattern of the gene expression levels across the NSC lineage, providing insight into deciphering the molecular basis of NSC differentiation.},

	abstract = {Background: Accurately recognizing nitrated tyrosine residues from protein sequences would pave a way for understanding the mechanism of nitration and the screening of the tyrosine residues in sequences. Results: In this study, we proposed a prediction model that used the extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm as the prediction engine to identify nitrated tyrosine residues. To encode each tyrosine residue, a sliding window technique was adopted to extract a peptide segment for each tyrosine residue, from which a number of features were extracted. These features were analyzed by a popular feature selection method, Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) method, producing a feature list, in which all features were ranked in a rigorous way. Then, the Incremental Feature Selection (IFS) method was utilized to discover the optimal features, on which the optimal ELM-based prediction model was built. This model produced satisfactory results on the training dataset with a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.757. The model was also evaluated by an independent test dataset that contained only positive samples, yielding a sensitivity of 0.938. Conclusion: Compared to other prediction models that use classic machine learning algorithms as prediction engines on the same datasets with their own optimal features, the optimal ELM-based prediction model produced much better results, indicating the superiority of the proposed model for the identification of nitrated tyrosine residues from protein sequences.},

DDI is a common cause of adverse drug reactions and sometimes also leads to improved therapeutic effects. Therefore, it is of great interest to discover novel DDIs according to their molecular properties and mechanisms in a robust and rigorous way. This paper attempts to predict effective DDIs using the following properties: (1) chemical interaction between drugs; (2) protein interactions between the targets of drugs; and (3) target enrichment of KEGG pathways. The data consisted of 7323 pairs of DDIs collected from the DrugBank and 36,615 pairs of drugs constructed by randomly combining two drugs. Each drug pair was represented by 465 features derived from the aforementioned three categories of properties. The random forest algorithm was adopted to train the prediction model. Some feature selection techniques, including minimum redundancy maximum relevance and incremental feature selection, were used to extract key features as the optimal input for the prediction model. The extracted key features may help to gain insights into the mechanisms of DDIs and provide some guidelines for the relevant clinical medication developments, and the prediction model can give new clues for identification of novel DDIs.},

Many synthetic compounds have emerged with the advancement of combinatorial chemistry. Identification of effective lung cancer candidate drug compounds among them is a great challenge. Thus, it is necessary to build effective computational methods that can assist us in selecting for potential lung cancer drug compounds. In this study, a computational method was proposed to tackle this problem. The chemical-chemical interactions and chemical-protein interactions were utilized to select candidate drug compounds that have close associations with approved lung cancer drugs and lung cancer-related genes. A permutation test and K-means clustering algorithm were employed to exclude candidate drugs with low possibilities to treat lung cancer. The final analysis suggests that the remaining drug compounds have potential anti-lung cancer activities and most of them have structural dissimilarity with approved drugs for lung cancer.},

	abstract = {Computational methods for post-translational modification (PTM) site prediction play important roles in protein function studies and experimental design. Most existing methods are based on feature extraction, which may result in incomplete or biased features. Deep learning as the cutting-edge machine learning method has the ability to automatically discover complex representations of PTM patterns from the raw sequences, and hence it provides a powerful tool for improvement of post-translational modification site prediction. In our previous work, we proposed MusiteDeep, the first deep-learning framework for predicting the phosphorylation, one of the well-studied PTMs. The previous MusiteDeep takes protein raw sequence as the input and uses convolutional neural networks with a two-dimensional attention mechanism. It achieved over a 50\% improvement in the area under the precision-recall curve in general phosphorylation site prediction and obtains competitive results in kinase-specific prediction compared to other well-known tools on the benchmark data. In this work, we extended to explore more types of PTMs, including acetylation, methylation and glycosylation. New deep-learning architecture and new training strategy are proposed for better performance. Web server for more PTM site predictions and complex motif visualization will be developed in the future.},

Recent experimental results on artificial data and theoretical results in restricted settings have shown that for selecting a good classifier from a set of classifiers (model selection), ten-fold cross-validation may be better than the more expensive leaveone-out cross-validation. We report on a largescale experiment -- over half a million runs of C4.5 and a Naive-Bayes algorithm -- to estimate the effects of different parameters on these algorithms on real-world datasets. For cross-validation, we vary the number of folds and whether the folds are stratified or not; for bootstrap, we vary the number of bootstrap samples. Our results indicate that for real-word datasets similar to ours, the best method to use for model selection is ten-fold stratified cross validation, even if computation power allows using more folds.},

No one measure is universally best for all accuracy assessment objectives, and different accuracy measures may lead to conflicting conclusions because the measures do not represent accuracy in the same way Choosing appropriate accuracy measures that address objectives of the mapping project is critical. Characteristics of some commonly used accuracy measures are described, and relationships among these measures are provided to aid the user in choosing an appropriate measure. Accuracy measures that are directly interpretable as probabilities of encountering certain. types of misclassification errors or correct classifications should be selected in preference to measures not interpretable as such. User's and producer's accuracy and the overall proportion of area correctly classified are examples of accuracy measures possessing the desired probabilistic interpretation. The kappa coefficient of agreement does not possess such a probabilistic interpretation because of the adjustment for hypothetical chance agreement incorporated into this measure, and the strong dependence of kappa on the marginal proportions of the error matrix makes the utility Of kappa for comparisons suspect. Normalizing ng an error matrix results in estimates that are not consistent for accuracy parameters of the ?nap being assessed, so that this procedure is generally not warranted for most applications.

	abstract = {Background: Ubiquitylation plays an important role in regulating protein functions. Recently, experimental methods were developed toward effective identification of ubiquitylation sites. To efficiently explore more undiscovered ubiquitylation sites, this study aims to develop an accurate sequence-based prediction method to identify promising ubiquitylation sites. Results: We established an ubiquitylation dataset consisting of 157 ubiquitylation sites and 3676 putative non-ubiquitylation sites extracted from 105 proteins in the UbiProt database. This study first evaluates promising sequence-based features and classifiers for the prediction of ubiquitylation sites by assessing three kinds of features (amino acid identity, evolutionary information, and physicochemical property) and three classifiers (support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, and NaiveBayes). Results show that the set of used 531 physicochemical properties and support vector machine (SVM) are the best kind of features and classifier respectively that their combination has a prediction accuracy of 72.19\% using leave-one-out cross-validation. Consequently, an informative physicochemical property mining algorithm (IPMA) is proposed to select an informative subset of 531 physicochemical properties. A prediction system UbiPred was implemented by using an SVM with the feature set of 31 informative physicochemical properties selected by IPMA, which can improve the accuracy from 72.19\% to 84.44\%. To further analyze the informative physicochemical properties, a decision tree method C5.0 was used to acquire if-then rule-based knowledge of predicting ubiquitylation sites. UbiPred can screen promising ubiquitylation sites from putative non-ubiquitylation sites using prediction scores. By applying UbiPred, 23 promising ubiquitylation sites were identified from an independent dataset of 3424 putative non-ubiquitylation sites, which were also validated by using the obtained prediction rules. Conclusion: We have proposed an algorithm IPMA for mining informative physicochemical properties from protein sequences to build an SVM-based prediction system UbiPred. UbiPred can predict ubiquitylation sites accompanied with a prediction score each to help biologists in identifying promising sites for experimental verification. UbiPred has been implemented as a web server and is available at http://iclab.life.nctu.edu.tw/ubipred.},

	abstract = {Tyrosine nitration is a covalent posttranslational protein modification derived from the reaction of proteins with nitrating agents. Protein nitration appears to be a selective process since not all tyrosine residues in proteins or all proteins are nitrated in vivo. To investigate factors that may determine the biological selectivity of protein tyrosine nitration, we developed an in vitro model consisting of three proteins with similar size but different three-dimensional structure and tyrosine content. Exposure of ribonuclease A to putative in vivo nitrating agents revealed preferential nitration of tyrosine residue Y-115. Tyrosine residue Y-23 and to a lesser extent residue Y-20 were preferentially ;nitrated in lysozyme, whereas tyrosine Y-102 was the only residue modified by nitration in phospholipase A(2). Tyrosine Y-115 was the residue modified by nitration after exposure of ribonuclease A to different nitrating agents: chemically synthesized peroxynitrite, nitric oxide, and superoxide generated by SIN-1 or myeloperoxidase (MPO)/H2O2 plus nitrite (NO2-) in the presence of bicarbonate/CO2. The nature of the nitrating agent determined in part the protein that would be predominantly modified by nitration in a mixture of all three proteins. Ribonuclease A was preferentially nitrated upon exposure to MPO/H2O2/NO2-, whereas phospholipase A(2) was the primary target for nitration upon exposure to peroxynitrite. The data also suggest that the exposure of the aromatic ring to the surface of the protein, the location of the tyrosine on a loop structure, and its association with a neighboring negative charge are some of the factors determining the selectivity of tyrosine nitration In proteins.

	abstract = {The occurrence of protein tyrosine nitration under disease conditions is now firmly established and represents a shift from the signal transducing physiological actions of .NO to oxidative and potentially pathogenic pathways. Tyrosine nitration is mediated by reactive nitrogen species such as peroxynitrite anion (ONOO-) and nitrogen dioxide (.NO2), formed as secondary products of .NO metabolism in the presence of oxidants including superoxide radicals (O-2(.-)), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and transition metal centers. The precise interplay between .NO and oxidants and the identification of the proximal intermediate(s) responsible for nitration in vivo have been under controversy. Despite the capacity of peroxynitrite to mediate tyrosine nitration in vitro, its role on nitration in vivo has been questioned, and alternative pathways, including the nitrite/H2O2/hemeperoxidase and transition metal-dependent mechanisms, have been proposed. A balanced analysis of existing evidence indicates that (i) different nitration pathways can contribute to tyrosine nitration in vivo, and (it) most, if not all, nitration pathways involve free radical biochemistry with carbonate radicals (CO3.-) and/or oxo-metal complexes oxidizing tyrosine to tyrosyl radical followed by the diffusion-controlled reaction with .NO2 to yield 3-nitrotyrosine. Although protein tyrosine nitration is a low-yield process in vivo, 3-nitrotyrosine has been revealed as a relevant biomarker of .NO-dependent oxidative stress; additionally, site-specific nitration focused on particular protein tyrosines may result in modification of function and promote a biological effect. Tissue distribution and quantitation of protein 3-nitrotyrosine, recognition of the predominant nitration pathways and individual identification of nitrated proteins in disease states open new avenues for the understanding and treatment of human pathologies.},

Principal among the nitric oxide-mediated protein modifications are: the nitric oxide-iron heme binding, the S-nitrosylation of reduced cysteine residues, and the C-nitration of tyrosine and tryptophan residues. With the exception of the nitric oxide binding to heme iron proteins, the other two modifications appear to require secondary reactions of nitric oxide and the formation of nitrogen oxides. The rapid development of analytical and immunological methodologies has allowed for the quantification of S-nitrosylated and C-nitrated proteins in vivo revealing an apparent selectivity and specificity of the proteins modified.

Nitrotyrosine was detected in atherosclerotic lesions of formalin-fixed human coronary arteries with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. Binding was pronounced in and around foamy macrophages within the atheroma deposits. Nitration was also observed in early subintimal fatty streaks. Antibody binding was completely blocked by co-incubation with 10mM nitrotyrosine, but not by equivalent concentrations of aminotyrosine or phosphotyrosine.

Aside from experimental approaches, several computational methods based on machine learning algorithms were recently proposed to predict malonylation sites. However, previous methods failed to address imbalanced data sizes between positive and negative samples.; OBJECTIVE: In this study, we identified the significant features of malonylation sites in a novel computational method which applied machine learning algorithms and balanced data sizes by applying synthetic minority over-sampling technique.; METHOD: Four types of features, namely, amino acid (AA) composition, position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), AA factor, and disorder were used to encode residues in protein segments. Then, a two-step feature selection procedure including maximum relevance minimum redundancy and incremental feature selection, together with random forest algorithm, was performed on the constructed hybrid feature vector.; RESULTS: An optimal classifier was built from the optimal feature subset, which featured an F1-measure of 0.356. Feature analysis was performed on several selected important features.; CONCLUSION: Results showed that certain types of PSSM and disorder features may be closely associated with malonylation of lysine residues. Our study contributes to development of computational approaches for predicting malonyllysine and provides insights into molecular mechanism of malonylation.

	abstract = {The cellular attributes of a protein, such as which compartment of a cell it belongs to and how it is associated with the lipid bilayer of an organelle, are closely correlated with its biological functions. The success of human genome project and the rapid increase in the number of protein sequences entering into data bank have stimulated a challenging frontier: How to develop a fast and accurate method to predict the cellular attributes of a protein based on its amino acid sequence? The existing algorithms for predicting these attributes were all based on the amino acid composition in which no sequence order effect was taken into account. To improve the prediction quality, it is necessary to incorporate such an effect. However, the number of possible patterns for protein sequences is extremely large, which has posed a formidable difficulty for realizing this goal. To deal with such a difficulty, the pseudo-amino acid composition is introduced. Pt is a combination of a set of discrete sequence correlation factors and the 20 components of the conventional amino acid composition. A remarkable improvement in prediction quality has been observed by using the pseudo-amino acid composition. The success rates of prediction thus obtained are so far the highest far the same classification schemes and same data sets. It has not escaped from our notice that the concept of pseudo-amino acid composition as well as its mathematical framework and biochemical implication may also have a notable impact on improving the prediction quality of other protein features.

	abstract = {Deep Learning has revolutionized vision via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and natural language processing via recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, success stories of Deep Learning with standard feed-forward neural networks (FNNs) are rare. FNNs that perform well are typically shallow and, therefore cannot exploit many levels of abstract representations. We introduce self-normalizing neural networks (SNNs) to enable high-level abstract representations. While batch normalization requires explicit normalization, neuron activations of SNNs automatically converge towards zero mean and unit variance. The activation function of SNNs are "scaled exponential linear units" (SELUs), which induce self-normalizing properties. Using the Banach fixed-point theorem, we prove that activations close to zero mean and unit variance that are propagated through many network layers will converge towards zero mean and unit variance -- even under the presence of noise and perturbations. This convergence property of SNNs allows to (1) train deep networks with many layers, (2) employ strong regularization, and (3) to make learning highly robust. Furthermore, for activations not close to unit variance, we prove an upper and lower bound on the variance, thus, vanishing and exploding gradients are impossible. We compared SNNs on (a) 121 tasks from the UCI machine learning repository, on (b) drug discovery benchmarks, and on (c) astronomy tasks with standard FNNs and other machine learning methods such as random forests and support vector machines. SNNs significantly outperformed all competing FNN methods at 121 UCI tasks, outperformed all competing methods at the Tox21 dataset, and set a new record at an astronomy data set. The winning SNN architectures are often very deep. Implementations are available at: github.com/bioinf-jku/SNNs.},

Previous GPU based tree building algorithms are based on parallel multi-scan or radix sort to find the exact tree split, and thus suffer from scalability and performance issues. We show that using a histogram based algorithm to approximately find the best split is more efficient and scalable on GPU. By identifying the difference between classical GPU-based image histogram construction and the feature histogram construction in decision tree training, we develop a fast feature histogram building kernel on GPU with carefully designed computational and memory access sequence to reduce atomic update conflict and maximize GPU utilization. Our algorithm can be used as a drop-in replacement for histogram construction in popular tree boosting systems to improve their scalability. As an example, to train GBDT on epsilon dataset, our method using a main-stream GPU is 7-8 times faster than histogram based algorithm on CPU in LightGBM and 25 times faster than the exact-split finding algorithm in XGBoost on a dual-socket 28-core Xeon server, while achieving similar prediction accuracy.},

To have a better insight of the mechanisms underlying pupylation an initial, but important, step is to identify pupylation sites. To date, several computational methods have been established for the prediction of pupylation sites which usually artificially design the negative samples using the verified pupylation proteins to train the classifiers. However, if this process is not properly done it can affect the performance of the final predictor dramatically. In this work, different from previous computational methods, we proposed an enhanced positive-unlabeled learning algorithm (EPuL) to the pupylation site prediction problem, which uses only positive and unlabeled samples. Firstly, we separate the training dataset into the positive dataset and the unlabeled dataset which contains the remaining non-annotated lysine residues. Then, the EPuL algorithm is utilized to select the reliably negative initial dataset and then iteratively pick out the non-pupylation sites. The performance of the proposed method was measured with an accuracy of 90.24\%, an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.93 and an MCC of 0.81 by 10-fold cross-validation.

Two novel methods, position weight determination (PWD) and scoring matrix optimization (SMO), were developed. Compared with other existing tools, GPS 5.0 exhibits a highly competitive accuracy. Besides serine/threonine or tyrosine kinases, GPS 5.0 also supports the prediction of dual-specificity kinase-specific p-sites. In the classical module of GPS 5.0, 617 individual predictors were constructed for predicting p-sites of 479 human PKs. To extend the application of GPS 5.0, a species-specific module was implemented to predict kinase-specific p-sites for 44,795 PKs in 161 eukaryotes. The online service and local packages of GPS 5.0 are freely available for academic research at http://gps.biocuckoo.cn.},

Due to the explosive expansion of the amount of PLM substrates and the discovery of novel PLM types, here we greatly updated our previous studies, and presented a much more integrative resource of protein lysine modification database (PLMD). In PLMD, we totally collected and integrated 284,780 modification events in 53,501 proteins across 176 eukaryotes and prokaryotes for up to 20 types of PLMs, including ubiquitination, acetylation, sumoylation, methylation, succinylation, malonylation, glutarylation, glycation, formylation, hydroxylation, butyrylation, propionylation, crotonylation, pupylation, neddylation, 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation, phosphoglycerylation, carboxylation, lipoylation and biotinylation. Using the data set, a motif-based analysis was performed for each PLM type, and the results demonstrated that different PLM types preferentially recognize distinct sequence motifs for the modifications. Moreover, various PLMs synergistically orchestrate specific cellular biological processes by mutual crosstalks with each other, and we totally found 65,297 PLM events involved in 90 types of PLM co-occurrences on the same lysine residues. Finally, various options were provided for accessing the data, while original references and other annotations were also present for each PLM substrate. Taken together, we anticipated the PLMD database can serve as a useful resource for further researches of PLMs. PLMD 3.0 was implemented in PHP + MySQL and freely available at http://plmd.biocuckoo.org.},

PTMs are the chemical modification of a protein after its translation and have wide effects broadening its range of functionality. Based on previous estimates, it is widely believed that more than half of proteins are glycoproteins. Whereas mutations can only occur once per position, different forms of post-translational modifications may occur in tandem. With the number and abundances of modifications constantly being discovered, there is no method to readily assess their relative levels. Here we report the relative abundances of each PTM found experimentally and putatively, from high-quality, manually curated, proteome-wide data and show that at best, less than one-fifth of proteins are glycosylated.

Thus, exploring the differences in functional genes in DS samples with and without AVSD is a critical way to investigate the complex association between AVSD and DS. In this study, we present a computational method to distinguish DS patients with AVSD from those without AVSD using the newly proposed self-normalizing neural network (SNN). First, each patient was encoded by using the copy number of probes on chromosome 21. The encoded features were ranked by the reliable Monte Carlo feature selection (MCFS) method to obtain a ranked feature list. Based on this feature list, we used a two-stage incremental feature selection to construct two series of feature subsets and applied SNNs to build classifiers to identify optimal features. Results show that 2737 optimal features were obtained, and the corresponding optimal SNN classifier constructed on optimal features yielded a Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) value of 0.748. For comparison, random forest was also used to build classifiers and uncover optimal features. This method received an optimal MCC value of 0.582 when top 132 features were utilized. Finally, we analyzed some key features derived from the optimal features in SNNs found in literature support to further reveal their essential roles.},

	abstract = {Background: Myristoylation is an important hydrophobic post-translational modification that is covalently bound to the amino group of Gly residues on the N-terminus of proteins. The many diverse functions of myristoylation on proteins, such as membrane targeting, signal pathway regulation and apoptosis, are largely due to the lipid modification, whereas abnormal or irregular myristoylation on proteins can lead to several pathological changes in the cell. Objective: To better understand the function of myristoylated sites and to correctly identify them in protein sequences, this study conducted a novel computational investigation on identifying myristoylation sites in protein sequences. Materials and Methods: A training dataset with 196 positive and 84 negative peptide segments were obtained. Four types of features derived from the peptide segments following the myristoylation sites were used to specify myristoylatedand non-myristoylated sites. Then, feature selection methods including maximum relevance and minimum redundancy (mRMR), incremental feature selection (IFS), and a machine learning algorithm (extreme learning machine method) were adopted to extract optimal features for the algorithm to identify myristoylation sites in protein sequences, thereby building an optimal prediction model. Results: As a result, 41 key features were extracted and used to build an optimal prediction model. The effectiveness of the optimal prediction model was further validated by its performance on a test dataset. Furthermore, detailed analyses were also performed on the extracted 41 features to gain insight into the mechanism of myristoylation modification. Conclusion: This study provided a new computational method for identifying myristoylation sites in protein sequences. We believe that it can be a useful tool to predict myristoylation sites from protein sequences.},

Accurate identification of bacteriophage virion proteins is very important for understanding their functions and clarifying the lysis mechanism of bacterial cells. In this study, a new sequence-based method was developed to identify phage virion proteins. In the new method, the protein sequences were initially formulated by the g-gap dipeptide compositions. Subsequently, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) with incremental feature selection (IFS) was used to search for the optimal feature set. It was observed that, in jackknife cross-validation, the optimal feature set including 160 optimized features can produce the maximum accuracy of 85.02\%. By performing feature analysis, we found that the correlation between two amino acids with one gap was more important than other correlations for phage virion protein prediction and that some of the 1-gap dipeptides were important and mainly contributed to the virion protein prediction. This analysis will provide novel insights into the function of phage virion proteins. On the basis of the proposed method, an online web-server, PVPred, was established and can be freely accessed from the website (http://lin.uestc.edu.cn/server/PVPred). We believe that the PVPred will become a powerful tool to study phage virion proteins and to guide the related experimental validations.},

In this update, dbPTM not only integrates more experimentally validated PTMs from available databases and through manual curation of literature but also provides PTM-disease associations based on non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs). The high-throughput deep sequencing technology has led to a surge in the data generated through analysis of association between SNPs and diseases, both in terms of growth amount and scope. This update thus integrated disease-associated nsSNPs from dbSNP based on genome-wide association studies. The PTM substrate sites located at a specified distance in terms of the amino acids encoded from nsSNPs were deemed to have an association with the involved diseases. In recent years, increasing evidence for crosstalk between PTMs has been reported. Although mass spectrometry-based proteomics has substantially improved our knowledge about substrate site specificity of single PTMs, the fact that the crosstalk of combinatorial PTMs may act in concert with the regulation of protein function and activity is neglected. Because of the relatively limited information about concurrent frequency and functional relevance of PTM crosstalk, in this update, the PTM sites neighboring other PTM sites in a specified window length were subjected to motif discovery and functional enrichment analysis. This update highlights the current challenges in PTM crosstalk investigation and breaks the bottleneck of how proteomics may contribute to understanding PTM codes, revealing the next level of data complexity and proteomic limitation in prospective PTM research.},

This can be achieved by using two-dimensional gel-based methods and imaging or by using liquid-chromatography–mass-spectrometry together with peptide-intensity-profiling or stable-isotope-labelling approaches.Functional phosphoproteomics studies are delineating cellular signal-transduction cascades and revealing new regulatory mechanisms in microbes, plants and mammals.},

This matrix increases sensitivity by giving high scores to those amino acid replacements which occur frequently in evolution. The algorithm has been implemented in a computer program designed to search protein databases very rapidly.

	abstract = {Lipid-modified proteins are classified based on the identity of the attached lipid, a post- or co-translational modification required for their biological function. At least five different lipid modifications of cysteines, glycines and other residues on the COOH- and NH2-terminal domains have been described. Cysteine residues may be modified by the addition of a 16-carbon saturated fatty acyl group by a labile thioester bond (palmitoylation) or by prenylation processes that catalyze the formation of thioether bond with mevalonate derived isoprenoids, farnesol and geranylgeraniol. The NH2-terminal glycine residues may undergo a quite distinct process involving the formation of an amide bond with a 14-carbon saturated acyl group (myristoylation), while glycine residues in the COOH-terminal may be covalently attached with a cholesterol moiety by an ester bond. Finally, cell surface proteins can be anchored to the membrane through the addition of glycosylphosphatidylinositol moiety. Several lines of evidence suggest that lipid-modified proteins are directly involved in different steps of the development of lesions of atherosclerosis, from leukocyte recruitment to plaque rupture, and their expression or lipid modification are likely altered during atherogenesis. This review will briefly summarize the different enzymatic pathways of lipid modification and propose a series of lipid-modified proteins that can be used as biomarkers for cardiovascular disease.},

The function of a modified protein is often strongly affected by these modifications and therefore increased knowledge about the potential PTMs of a target protein may increase our understanding of the molecular processes in which it takes part. High-throughput methods for the identification of PTMs are being developed, in particular within the fields of proteomics and mass spectrometry. However, these methods are still in their early stages, and it is indeed advantageous to cut down on the number of experimental steps by integrating computational approaches into the validation procedures. Many advanced methods for the prediction of PTMs exist and many are made publicly available. We describe our experiences with the development of prediction methods for phosphorylation and glycosylation sites and the development of PTM-specific databases. In addition, we discuss novel ideas for PTM visualization (exemplified by kinase landscapes) and improvements for prediction specificity (by using ESS--evolutionary stable sites). As an example, we present a new method for kinase-specific prediction of phosphorylation sites, NetPhosK, which extends our earlier and more general tool, NetPhos. The new server, NetPhosK, is made publicly available at the URL http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhosK/. The issues of underestimation, over-prediction and strategies for improving prediction specificity are also discussed.},

In response to the rapid increase in the amount of sequencing data produced by the next-generation sequencing technologies, we have developed a new CD-HIT program accelerated with a novel parallelization strategy and some other techniques to allow efficient clustering of such datasets. Our tests demonstrated very good speedup derived from the parallelization for up to ∼24 cores and a quasi-linear speedup for up to ∼8 cores. The enhanced CD-HIT is capable of handling very large datasets in much shorter time than previous versions.

The accurate identification of glycation sites is important to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of glycation.

In this study, a novel predictor named BPB\_GlySite is proposed to predict lysine glycation sites by using bi-profile bayes feature extraction and support vector machine algorithm. As illustrated by 10-fold cross-validation, BPB\_GlySite achieves a satisfactory performance with a Sensitivity of 63.68\%, a Specificity of 72.60\%, an Accuracy of 69.63\% and a Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.3499. Experimental results also indicate that BPB\_GlySite significantly outperforms three existing glycation sites predictors: NetGlycate, PreGly and Gly-PseAAC. Therefore, BPB\_GlySite can be a useful bioinformatics tool for the prediction of glycation sites. A user-friendly web-server for BPB\_GlySite is established at 123.206.31.171/BPB\_GlySite/.},

Experimental identification of ubiquitination sites is challenging due to rapid turnover of ubiquitinated proteins and the large size of the ubiquitin modifier. We identified 141 new ubiquitination sites using a combination of liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, and mutant yeast strains. Investigation of the sequence biases and structural preferences around known ubiquitination sites indicated that their properties were similar to those of intrinsically disordered protein regions. Using a combined set of new and previously known ubiquitination sites, we developed a random forest predictor of ubiquitination sites, UbPred. The class-balanced accuracy of UbPred reached 72\%, with the area under the ROC curve at 80\%. The application of UbPred showed that high confidence Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase substrates and proteins with very short half-lives were significantly enriched in the number of predicted ubiquitination sites. Proteome-wide prediction of ubiquitination sites in Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicated that highly ubiquitinated substrates were prevalent among transcription/enzyme regulators and proteins involved in cell cycle control. In the human proteome, cytoskeletal, cell cycle, regulatory, and cancer-associated proteins display higher extent of ubiquitination than proteins from other functional categories. We show that gain and loss of predicted ubiquitination sites may likely represent a molecular mechanism behind a number of disease-associatedmutations. UbPred is available at http://www.ubpred.org.},

To that end, this work examines a set of filter-style feature selection algorithms inspired by the `Relief' algorithm, i.e. Relief-Based algorithms (RBAs). We implement and expand these RBAs in an open source framework called ReBATE (Relief-Based Algorithm Training Environment). We apply a comprehensive genetic simulation study comparing existing RBAs, a proposed RBA called MultiSURF, and other established feature selection methods, over a variety of problems. The results of this study (1) support the assertion that RBAs are particularly flexible, efficient, and powerful feature selection methods that differentiate relevant features having univariate, multivariate, epistatic, or heterogeneous associations, (2) confirm the efficacy of expansions for classification vs. regression, discrete vs. continuous features, missing data, multiple classes, or class imbalance, (3) identify previously unknown limitations of specific RBAs, and (4) suggest that while MultiSURF* performs best for explicitly identifying pure 2-way interactions, MultiSURF yields the most reliable feature selection performance across a wide range of problem types.},

	abstract = {Post Translational Modification (PTM) is considered an important biological process with a tremendous impact on the function of proteins in both eukaryotes, and prokaryotes cells. During the past decades, a wide range of PTMs has been identified. Among them, malonylation is a recently identified PTM which plays a vital role in a wide range of biological interactions. Notwithstanding, this modification plays a potential role in energy metabolism in different species including Homo Sapiens. The identification of PTM sites using experimental methods is time-consuming and costly. Hence, there is a demand for introducing fast and cost-effective computational methods. In this study, we propose a new machine learning method, called Mal-Light, to address this problem. To build this model, we extract local evolutionary-based information according to the interaction of neighboring amino acids using a bi-peptide based method. We then use Light Gradient Boosting (LightGBM) as our classifier to predict malonylation sites. Our results demonstrate that Mal-Light is able to significantly improve malonylation site prediction performance compared to previous studies found in the literature. Using Mal-Light we achieve Matthew \& x2019;s correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.74 and 0.60, Accuracy of 86.66\% and 79.51\%, Sensitivity of 78.26\% and 67.27\%, and Specificity of 95.05\% and 91.75\%, for Homo Sapiens and Mus Musculus proteins, respectively.

Methods: In this study, a novel computational tool, abbreviated as predCitru-Site, has been developed to predict citrullination sites. This technique effectively has incorporated the sequence-coupling effect of surrounding amino acids of arginine residues as well as optimizes skewed training citrullination dataset for prediction quality improvement. The performance of predCitruSite has been measured from the average of 5 complete runs of the 10-fold cross-validation test to comply with existing tools. Results and Conclusion: predCitru-Site has achieved 97.6\% sensitivity, 98.9\% specificity, and overall accuracy of 98.5\%. With Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.967, it has also shown an area under the receiver operator characteristics curve of 0.997. Compared with existing tools, predCitru-Site significantly outperforms on the same benchmark dataset. It also shows significant improvement in the case of independent tests in all performance metrics (around 50\% higher in AUC).

An alternative in silico approach is predicting the phosphoproteomic profiles of cancer patients from the available proteomic, transcriptomic and genomic data. Results: Here, we present a winning algorithm in the 2017 NCI-CPTAC DREAM Proteogenomics Challenge for predicting phosphorylation levels of the proteome across cancer patients. We integrate four components into our algorithm, including (i) baseline correlations between protein and phosphoprotein abundances, (ii) universal protein-protein interactions, (iii) shareable regulatory information across cancer tissues and (iv) associations among multi-phosphorylation sites of the same protein.

	abstract = {As a reversible and widely existing post-translational modification of proteins, acetylation plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, and cytokine signaling. To better understand the molecular mechanism of acetylation, identification of acetylation sites is vital. The traditional experimental methods are time-consuming and cost-prohibitive, and the majority of acetylation sites remain unknown. It is necessary to develpoe an effective and accurate computational approach to predict the acetylation sites, especially utilizing the advanced deep learning technique. In this study, we propose a prokaryote acetylation sites prediction method based on the deep neural networks, named DNNAce. We extract the protein features from sequence information, physicochemical information, and evolution information of amino acid residues and obtain the initial feature set All. Moreover, we use Group Lasso to remove the irrelevant features that are not effective for classification in the sites prediction area. Compared to other machine learning methods, we use deep neural networks to predict acetylation sites. The 10-fold cross-validation on independent test datasets indicates that DNNAce has the highest values of accuracy for predicting acetylation sites. That DNNAce accurately identifies acetylation sites assists us in understanding its molecular mechanism, and provides related theoretical foundation for the development of drug targets for various diseases.

This is because the information thus obtained is very useful for in-depth understanding the biological processes at the cellular level and for developing effective drugs against major diseases including cancers as well. Although this can be done by means of various experimental techniques, it is both time-consuming and costly to determine the PTM sites purely based on experiments. With the avalanche of biological sequences generated in the post-genomic age, it is highly desired to develop bioinformatics tools for rapidly and effectively identifying the PTM sites. In the last few years, many efforts have been made in this regard, and considerable progresses have been achieved. This review is focused on those prediction methods that have the following two features. (1) They have been developed by strictly observing the 5-steps rule so that they each have a user-friendly web-server for the majority of experimental scientists to easily get their desired data without the need to go through the detailed mathematics involved. (2) Their cornerstones have been based on Pseudo Amino Acid Composition (PseAAC) or Pseudo K-tuple Nucleotide Composition (PseKNC), and hence the prediction quality is generally higher than most of the other PTM prediction methods.},

Considering the high-cost and labor-intensive of experimental identification, many computational prediction methods are currently available for the prediction of PTM sites by using protein local sequence information in the context of conserved motif. Here we proposed a novel computational method by using the combination of multiple kernel support vector machines (SVM) for predicting PTM sites including phosphorylation, O-linked glycosylation, acetylation, sulfation and nitration. To largely make use of local sequence information and site-modification relationships, we developed a local sequence kernel and Gaussian interaction profile kernel, respectively. Multiple kernels were further combined to train SVM for efficiently leveraging kernel information to boost predictive performance. We compared the proposed method with existing PTM prediction methods. The experimental results revealed that the proposed method performed comparable or better performance than the existing prediction methods, suggesting the feasibility of the developed kernels and the usefulness of the proposed method in PTM sites prediction.},

In our investigation, we notice that a number of existing selection criteria implicitly select features that preserve sample similarity, and can be unified under a common framework. We further point out that any feature selection criteria covered by this framework cannot handle redundant features, a common drawback of these criteria. Motivated by these observations, we propose a new "Similarity Preserving Feature Selection” framework in an explicit and rigorous way. We show, through theoretical analysis, that the proposed framework not only encompasses many widely used feature selection criteria, but also naturally overcomes their common weakness in handling feature redundancy. In developing this new framework, we begin with a conventional combinatorial optimization formulation for similarity preserving feature selection, then extend it with a sparse multiple-output regression formulation to improve its efficiency and effectiveness. A set of three algorithms are devised to efficiently solve the proposed formulations, each of which has its own advantages in terms of computational complexity and selection performance. As exhibited by our extensive experimental study, the proposed framework achieves superior feature selection performance and attractive properties.},

A broad spectrum of successful uses calls for especially careful investigation of various features Relief algorithms have.

	abstract = {The analysis of biological information from protein sequences is important for the study of cellular functions and interactions, and protein fold recognition plays a key role in the prediction of protein structures. Unfortunately, the prediction of protein fold patterns is challenging due to the existence of compound protein structures. Here, we processed the latest release of the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP, version 1.75) database and exploited novel techniques to impressively increase the accuracy of protein fold classification. The techniques proposed in this paper include ensemble classifying and a hierarchical framework, in the first layer of which similar or redundant sequences were deleted in two manners; a set of base classifiers, fused by various selection strategies, divides the input into seven classes; in the second layer of which, an analogous ensemble method is adopted to predict all protein folds. To our knowledge, it is the first time all protein folds can be intelligently detected hierarchically. Compared with prior studies, our experimental results demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed method, which achieved a success rate of 74.21\%, which is much higher than results obtained with previous methods (ranging from 45.6\% to 70.5\%). When applied to the second layer of classification, the prediction accuracy was in the range between 23.13\% and 46.05\%. This value, which may not be remarkably high, is scientifically admirable and encouraging as compared to the relatively low counts of proteins from most fold recognition programs.

	abstract = {Prokaryotic proteins are regulated by pupylation, a type of post-translational modification that contributes to cellular function in bacterial organisms. In pupylation process, the prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein (Pup) tagging is functionally analogous to ubiquitination in order to tag target proteins for proteasomal degradation. To date, several experimental methods have been developed to identify pupylated proteins and their pupylation sites, but these experimental methods are generally laborious and costly. Therefore, computational methods that can accurately predict potential pupylation sites based on protein sequence information are highly desirable. In this paper, a novel predictor termed as pbPUP has been developed for accurate prediction of pupylation sites. In particular, a sophisticated sequence encoding scheme [i.e. the profile-based composition of k-spaced amino acid pairs (pbCKSAAP)] is used to represent the sequence patterns and evolutionary information of the sequence fragments surrounding pupylation sites. Then, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained using the pbCKSAAP encoding scheme. The final pbPUP predictor achieves an AUC value of 0.849 in 10-fold cross-validation tests and outperforms other existing predictors on a comprehensive independent test dataset. The proposed method is anticipated to be a helpful computational resource for the prediction of pupylation sites.

	abstract = {Ubiquitination is an essential process in protein post-translational modification, which plays a crucial role in cell life activities, such as proteasomal degradation, transcriptional regulation, and DNA damage repair. Therefore, recognition of ubiquitination sites is a crucial step to understand the molecular mechanisms of ubiquitination. However, the experimental verification of numerous ubiquitination sites is time-consuming and costly. To alleviate these issues, a computational approach is needed to predict ubiquitination sites. This paper proposes a new method called UbiSitePred for predicting ubiquitination sites combined least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) feature selection and support vector machine. First, we use binary encoding (BE), pseudo-amino acid composition (PseAAC), the composition of k-spaced amino acid pairs (CKSAAP), position-specific propensity matrices (PSPM) to extract the sequence feature information; thus, the initial feature space is obtained. Secondly, LASSO is applied to remove the feature redundancy information and selects the optimal feature subset. Finally, the optimal feature subset is input into the support vector machine (SVM) to predict the ubiquitination sites. Five-fold cross-validation shows that UbiSitePred model can achieve a better prediction performance compared with other methods, the AUC values for Set1, Set2, and Set3 are 0.9998, 0.8887, and 0.8481, respectively. Notably, the UbiSitePred has overall accuracy rates of 98.33\%, 81.12\%, and 76.90\%, respectively. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is significantly superior to other state-of-the-art prediction methods and provide a new idea for the prediction of other post-translational modification sites of proteins.

All significant and essential biological structures and functions relies on proteins and their respective biological functions. However, proteins cannot perform their unique biological significance independently. They have to interact with each other to realize the complicated biological processes in all living creatures including human beings. In other words, proteins depend on interactions (protein-protein interactions) to realize their significant effects. Thus, the significance comparison and quantitative contribution of candidate PPI features must be determined urgently. According to previous studies, 258 physical and chemical characteristics of proteins have been reported and confirmed to definitively affect the interaction efficiency of the related proteins. Among such features, essential physiochemical features of proteins like stoichiometric balance, protein abundance, molecular weight and charge distribution have been validated to be quite significant and irreplaceable for protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Therefore, in this study, we, on one hand, presented a novel computational framework to identify the key factors affecting PPIs with Boruta feature selection (BFS), Monte Carlo feature selection (MCFS), incremental feature selection (IFS) and on the other hand, built a quantitative decision-rule system to evaluate the potential PPIs under real conditions with random forest (RF) and RIPPER algorithms, thereby supplying several new insights into the detailed biological mechanisms of complicated PPIs.},

Comparative transcriptome studies have been previously conducted to analyze differentially expressed genes between LSC+ and LSC- cells. However, these studies mainly focused on a limited number of genes with the most obvious expression differences between the two cell types. We developed a computational approach incorporating several machine learning algorithms, including Monte Carlo feature selection (MCFS), incremental feature selection (IFS), support vector machine (SVM), Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction (RIPPER), to identify gene expression features specific to LSCs. One thousand 0ne hudred fifty-nine features (genes) were first identified, which can be used to build the optimal SVM classifier for distinguishing LSC+ and LSC- cells. Among these 1159 genes, the top 17 genes were identified as LSC-specific biomarkers. In addition, six classification rules were produced by RIPPER algorithm. The subsequent literature review on these features/genes and the classification rules and functional enrichment analyses of the 1159 features/genes confirmed the relevance of extracted genes and rules to the characteristics of LSCs.},

	abstract = {Oral cancer (OC) is one of the most common cancers threatening human lives. However, OC pathogenesis has yet to be fully uncovered, and thus designing effective treatments remains difficult. Identifying genes related to OC is an important way for achieving this purpose. In this study, we proposed three computational models for inferring novel OC-related genes. In contrast to previously proposed computational methods, which lacked the learning procedures, each proposed model adopted a one-class learning algorithm, which can provide a deep insight into features of validated OC-related genes. A network embedding algorithm (i.e., node2vec) was applied to the protein-protein interaction network to produce the representation of genes. The features of the OC-related genes were used in the training of the one-class algorithm, and the performance of the final inferring model was improved through a feature selection procedure. Then, candidate genes were produced by applying the trained inferring model to other genes. Three tests were performed to screen out the important candidate genes. Accordingly, we obtained three inferred gene sets, any two of which were different. The inferred genes were also different from previous reported genes and some of them have been included in the public Oral Cancer Gene Database. Finally, we analyzed several inferred genes to confirm whether they are novel OC-related genes.},

With the development of high-throughput sequencing technologies, the combination of conventional clinical symptoms and new genetic events is becoming effective and has been approved for precise prediction and innovative diagnostic strategies. Epigenetic modification (e.g., DNA methylation) is an important mechanism of transcriptional control in normal or disease functions. Depending on the unique methylation profiles, an important possibility raised is that the characteristic of dys-methylation could provide a new molecular marker system for the identification of the major forms of tumors. In this study, we attempted to distinguish different tumor types. On the basis of DNA methylation data from PanCanAtlas in The Cancer Genome Atlas, we applied mRMR and MCFS methods together to identify the decision rules for distinguishing 33 different tumor types and ranked the features that characterized methylation level. This study highlights the considerable application potential of methylation features in cancer diagnosis and provides insight into novel therapeutic targets.},

It is reported that they play important roles in tumorigenesis via various regulatory modes. snoRNAs can both participate in the regulation of methylation and pseudouridylation and regulate the expression pattern of their host genes. This research investigated the expression pattern of snoRNAs in eight major cancer types in TCGA via several machine learning algorithms. The expression levels of snoRNAs were first analyzed by a powerful feature selection method, Monte Carlo feature selection (MCFS). A feature list and some informative features were accessed. Then, the incremental feature selection (IFS) was applied to the feature list to extract optimal features/snoRNAs, which can make the support vector machine (SVM) yield best performance. The discriminative snoRNAs included HBII-52-14, HBII-336, SNORD123, HBII-85-29, HBII-420, U3, HBI-43, SNORD116, SNORA73B, SCARNA4, HBII-85-20, etc., on which the SVM can provide a Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.881 for predicting these eight cancer types. On the other hand, the informative features were fed into the Johnson reducer and repeated incremental pruning to produce error reduction (RIPPER) algorithms to generate classification rules, which can clearly show different snoRNAs expression patterns in different cancer types. The analysis results indicated that extracted discriminative snoRNAs can be important for identifying cancer samples in different types and the expression pattern of snoRNAs in different cancer types can be partly uncovered by quantitative recognition rules.},

	abstract = {Among the protein post-translational modifications (PTMs), ubiquitination is considered as one of the most significant processes which can regulate the cellular functions and various diseases. Identification of ubiquitination sites becomes important for understanding the mechanisms of ubiquitination-related biological processes. Both experimental and computational approaches are available for identifying ubiquitination sites based on protein sequences of different species. The experimental approaches are time-consuming, laborious and costly. In silico prediction is an alternative time saving, easier and cost-effective approach for identifying ubiquitination sites. Moreover, the sequence patterns in the different species around the ubiquitination sites are not similar which demands species-specific predictors. Therefore, in this study, we have proposed a novel computational method for identifying ubiquitination sites based on protein sequences of A. thaliana species which will be robust against outlying observations also. Through the comparative study of two encoding schemes and three classifiers, the random forest (RF) based predictor was selected as the best predictor under the CKSAAP encoding scheme with 1:1 ratio of positive and negative samples (i.e. ubiquitinated and non-ubiquitinated) in training dataset. The proposed predictor produced the area under the ROC curve (AUC score) as 0.91 and 0.86 for 5-fold cross-validation test with the training dataset and the independent test dataset of A. thaliana respectively. The proposed RF based predictor also performed much better than the other existing ubiquitination sites predictors for A. thaliana.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12918-018-0628-0},
	abstract = {Background: Ubiquitination, which is also called "lysine ubiquitination", occurs when an ubiquitin is attached to lysine (K) residues in targeting proteins. As one of the most important post translational modifications (PTMs), it plays the significant role not only in protein degradation, but also in other cellular functions. Thus, systematic anatomy of the ubiquitination proteome is an appealing and challenging research topic. The existing methods for identifying protein ubiquitination sites can be divided into two kinds: mass spectrometry and computational methods. Mass spectrometry-based experimental methods can discover ubiquitination sites from eukaryotes, but are time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, it is priority to develop computational approaches that can effectively and accurately identify protein ubiquitination sites. Results: The existing computational methods usually require feature engineering, which may lead to redundancy and biased representations. While deep learning is able to excavate underlying characteristics from large-scale training data via multiple-layer networks and non-linear mapping operations. In this paper, we proposed a deep architecture within multiple modalities to identify the ubiquitination sites. First, according to prior knowledge and biological knowledge, we encoded protein sequence fragments around candidate ubiquitination sites into three modalities, namely raw protein sequence fragments, physico-chemical properties and sequence profiles, and designed different deep network layers to extract the hidden representations from them. Then, the generative deep representations corresponding to three modalities were merged to build the final model. We performed our algorithm on the available largest scale protein ubiquitination sites database PLMD, and achieved 66.4\% specificity, 66.7\% sensitivity, 66.43\% accuracy, and 0.221 MCC value. A number of comparative experiments also indicated that our multimodal deep architecture outperformed several popular protein ubiquitination site prediction tools. Conclusion: The results of comparative experiments validated the effectiveness of our deep network and also displayed that our method outperformed several popular protein ubiquitination site prediction tools. The source codes of our proposed method are available at https://github.com/jiagenlee/deepUbiquitylation.},

	abstract = {As one of the most important reversible protein post-translation modifications, ubiquitination has been reported to be involved in lots of biological processes and closely implicated with various diseases. To fully decipher the molecular mechanisms of ubiquitination-related biological processes, an initial but crucial step is the recognition of ubiquitylated substrates and the corresponding ubiquitination sites. Here, a new bioinformatics tool named CKSAAP\_UbSite was developed to predict ubiquitination sites from protein sequences. With the assistance of Support Vector Machine (SVM), the highlight of CKSAAP\_UbSite is to employ the composition of k-spaced amino acid pairs surrounding a query site (i.e. any lysine in a query sequence) as input. When trained and tested in the dataset of yeast ubiquitination sites (Radivojac et al, Proteins, 2010, 78: 365-380), a 100-fold cross-validation on a 1: 1 ratio of positive and negative samples revealed that the accuracy and MCC of CKSAAP\_UbSite reached 73.40\% and 0.4694, respectively. The proposed CKSAAP\_UbSite has also been intensively benchmarked to exhibit better performance than some existing predictors, suggesting that it can be served as a useful tool to the community. Currently, CKSAAP\_UbSite is freely accessible at http://protein.cau.edu.cn/cksaap\_ubsite/. Moreover, we also found that the sequence patterns around ubiquitination sites are not conserved across different species. To ensure a reasonable prediction performance, the application of the current CKSAAP\_UbSite should be limited to the proteome of yeast.},

The modifications we consider novel improve the ROC score from 0.758 +/- 0.005 to 0.895 +/- 0.003. This does not include the benefits from four modifications we included in the 'baseline' version, even though they were not implemented in PSI-BLAST version 2.0. The improvement in accuracy was confirmed on a small second test set. This test involved analyzing three protein families with curated lists of true positives from the non-redundant protein database. The modification that accounts for the majority of the improvement is the use, for each database sequence, of a position-specific scoring system tuned to that sequence's amino acid composition. The use of composition-based statistics is particularly beneficial for large-scale automated applications of PSI-BLAST.},

Much care and effort has therefore gone into constructing substitution matrices, and the quality of search results can depend strongly upon the choice of the proper matrix. A long-standing problem has been the comparison of sequences with biased amino acid compositions, for which standard substitution matrices are not optimal. To address this problem, we have recently developed a general procedure for transforming a standard matrix into one appropriate for the comparison of two sequences with arbitrary, and possibly differing compositions. Such adjusted matrices yield, on average, improved alignments and alignment scores when applied to the comparison of proteins with markedly biased compositions. Here we review the application of compositionally adjusted matrices and consider whether they may also be applied fruitfully to general purpose protein sequence database searches, in which related sequence pairs do not necessarily have strong compositional biases. Although it is not advisable to apply compositional adjustment indiscriminately, we describe several simple criteria under which invoking such adjustment is on average beneficial. In a typical database search, at least one of these criteria is satisfied by over half the related sequence pairs. Compositional substitution matrix adjustment is now available in NCBI's protein-protein version of blast.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-7-208},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Due to the functional importance of intrinsically disordered proteins or protein regions, prediction of intrinsic protein disorder from amino acid sequence has become an area of active research as witnessed in the 6th experiment on Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP6). Since the initial work by Romero et al. (Identifying disordered regions in proteins from amino acid sequences, IEEE Int. Conf. Neural Netw., 1997), our group has developed several predictors optimized for long disordered regions ({\textgreater}30 residues) with prediction accuracy exceeding 85\%. However, these predictors are less successful on short disordered regions ({\textless} or =30 residues). A probable cause is a length-dependent amino acid compositions and sequence properties of disordered regions.
RESULTS: We proposed two new predictor models, VSL2-M1 and VSL2-M2, to address this length-dependency problem in prediction of intrinsic protein disorder. These two predictors are similar to the original VSL1 predictor used in the CASP6 experiment. In both models, two specialized predictors were first built and optimized for short ({\textless} or = 30 residues) and long disordered regions ({\textgreater}30 residues), respectively. A meta predictor was then trained to integrate the specialized predictors into the final predictor model. As the 10-fold cross-validation results showed, the VSL2 predictors achieved well-balanced prediction accuracies of 81\% on both short and long disordered regions. Comparisons over the VSL2 training dataset via 10-fold cross-validation and a blind-test set of unrelated recent PDB chains indicated that VSL2 predictors were significantly more accurate than several existing predictors of intrinsic protein disorder.
CONCLUSION: The VSL2 predictors are applicable to disordered regions of any length and can accurately identify the short disordered regions that are often misclassified by our previous disorder predictors. The success of the VSL2 predictors further confirmed the previously observed differences in amino acid compositions and sequence properties between short and long disordered regions, and justified our approaches for modelling short and long disordered regions separately. The VSL2 predictors are freely accessible for non-commercial use at http://www.ist.temple.edu/disprot/predictorVSL2.php.},
